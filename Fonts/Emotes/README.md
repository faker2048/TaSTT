To add emotes to the text box, place one or more .png files in this directory.
The name of the file should be the word you will say in game to make the emote
appear.

For example,consider the following contents:

  Emotes/smile.png
  Emotes/cry.png

Saying "smile" would cause the image smile.png to show up on the text box.
