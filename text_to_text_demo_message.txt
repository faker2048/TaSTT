
Hello, my name is yum_food.
I'm a VRChat mute: a player that chooses not to use their microphone.
This repository contains the code for an in-game chat bubble.
It is designed with the core goals of being low latency, reliable, and free - free as in freedom, and as in beer.
All code is written from scratch and permissively licensed.
This project is in the exploratory phase. Once the core set of features are implemented, I will focus on productizing.
Until then, use with caution.
Contributions welcome!
